INTRODUCTION                                *mixer-introduction*

Provides utilities for working with the Elixir programming language
<https://elixir-lang.org>.  For Vim users, this compliments elixir.vim
<https://github.com/elixir-lang/vim-elixir>.  This plugin is designed to work
with nvim as well, though nvim users may also want to evaluate
elixir-tools.nvim <https://github.com/elixir-tools/elixir-tools.nvim>.  This
plugin can be used along-side it.


    PLEASE NOTE                                                        ~
  +--------------------------------------------------------------------+~
  | Almost all commands and mappings are BUFFER LOCAL and only defined |~
  | if they are available.  This means you must edit an elixir, heex,  |~
  | or surface file OR be inside a mix project to get the appropriate  |~
  | functionality.                                                     |~
  +--------------------------------------------------------------------+~


Passive Settings~
                                            *mixer-passive-settings*

                                            *mixer-commenting*
When working in files with embedded templates, 'commentstring' will be
adjusted appropriately based on where you cursor is.

Caveats:

  * This is set on |CursorHold|, so if you happen to have set a very slow
    |uptimedate|, then it's possible you could be too quick for it.
  * When commenting out both Elixir and HEEx/Surface in visual mode,
    'commentstring' will be whatever it was when you entered visual mode.

                                            *mixer-matchit*
Similar to above, if you have |matchit| enabled, `b:match_words` will be
automatically set based where your cursor position in the file, allowing you
to use |%| in embedded HEEs/Surface.

                                            *mixer-compiler*
If available, `:compiler mix` will be called for Elixir files and
`:compiler exunit` will be called for any Elixir file ending in `_test.exs`.
These are available if you have |elixir.vim| installed.  See the `complier/`
directory in that plugin if yout don't use it and wish to copy them over.

                                            *mixer-syntax-highliting*
Mixer will highlight common library macros like `using`, `plug`, `scope`, etc.
To turn off this behaviour, set:
>
  let g:mixer_syntax_highlighting = 0
<


COMMANDS                                    *mixer-commands*

                                            *mixer-commands-mix*
                                            *mixer-:Mix*
:Mix [args]         Run a mix command with autocomplete.

                    It will use an async library if available.  Currently,
                    it's aware of |dispatch|, |neomake|, |asyncrun|, and the
                    lesser known |asyncdo|.  The latter is by Elixir community
                    member @hauleth so I figured I'd include it :) You may
                    also configure it to use any command you want:
>
                      let g:mixer_async_command = 'Make'
<
                    If you wish to run a command synchronously using `:Mix`
                    (ie, get the output in the terminal session), you may do
                    so like this:
>
                      :Mix ! deps.get
<
                    Due to how Vim commands are parsed, you can also call it
                    as:
>
                      :Mix!! deps.get
<
                    This command is always available, even when not editing an
                    Elixir file.

                    A note on autocomplete: When editing a file in a Mix
                    project, its tasks will be populated and cached in the
                    background so that autocomplete is instant from first use.
                    When used outside of a mix project, there will be a slight
                    delay the first time you hit `<tab>` while it populates
                    the tasks.

                                            *mixer-:Mix!*
:Mix!               If using an async runner, it will do whatever it is your
                    chosen library's command does when called with a [!].

                                            *mixer-:Mix-env*
:Mix[!] ={env} [args]
                    Specify the environment.  For example:
>
                      :Mix =test compile
<
                    This works for any custom environment you have outside of
                    the standard "dev", "test", and "prod".  The `^` here
                    simply means "environment name."

                                            *mixer-:Mix-add-env*
:Mix[!] +{env} [args] 
                    Run task in {env} as well as the default.  For example:
>
                      :Mix +test mix compile
<
                    This will run:
>
                      $ mix compile && MIX_ENV=test mix compile
<

                                            *mixer-:Deps*
                                            *mixer-:Deps!*
:Deps               Navigate to `mix.exs` and jump to your `deps` function.
                    This works regardless of what you have called it.

:{range}Deps[!] {task} [args]
                    A wrapper around `:Mix deps`

                    When the current buffer is `mix.exs` it will first write
                    the buffer if it is modified.

                    In any other buffer it will take you to `mix.exs` and
                    jump to your `deps` function.  This works regardless of
                    what you have named it.

                    Given a {range}, it will operate on those lines.  This is
                    probably most useful with the current line for example,
                    with your cursor on this line:
>
                      {:live_view, "~> 0.20"},
<
                    You can update LiveView by calling:
>
                      :.Deps update
<
                    With the following lines visually selected:
>
                      {:floki, "~> 0.3"},
                      {:phoenix_test, "~> 1.7"},
                      {:pathex, "~> 2.5"},
                      {:image, "~> 0.5"}
<
                    Running
>
                      :'<,'>Deps update
<
                    will result in:
>
                      mix deps update floki phoenix_test pathex image
<
                    This is really more of a party trick as it's probably
                    pretty rare that the deps you want to update will be right
                    next to each other but hey, there it is!

                    This command's bang [!] behaviour works the same as it
                    does for |:Mix|.  Environment flags via `^` and `+` are
                    also available.

                                            *mixer-:Deps_add*
:Deps add {dep}     Insert {dep} below the cursor.

                    For example, with \%# being your cursor:
>
                      {:floki, "~> 0.3"},
                      {:phoenix_\%#test, "~> 1.7"},
                      {:image, "~> 0.5"}
<
                    Typing `:Deps add pathex` will result in:
>
                      {:floki, "~> 0.3"},
                      {:phoenix_test, "~> 1.7"},
                      {:pathex, "~> 2.5"},
                      {:image, "~> 0.5"}
<

                                            *mixer-:Gen* *:Gen*
:Gen                Unified generator command with autocomplete.

                    Run any `*.gen*` task in your project without having to
                    provide its namespace.

                    For example:
>
                      :Gen live Accounts User users name:string age:integer
                      :Gen migration add_name_to_users
<

                    Name collisions are resolved by appending the package
                    prefix separated by a dot (`.`).  For example, if you have
                    a Phoenix project that is using Guardian and you type
                    `:Gen sec<tab>` you will see:
>
                      :Gen secret.
                      secret.guardian secret.phx
<
                    Tasks are sorted by their non-namespaced names.

                    Since many generators prompt for input, this task is
                    always run via |:!|.


                                            *mixer-:Migrate* *:Migrate*
:{count}Migrate[!] [arg]
                    Run migrations with autocomplete.

                    {count} will be passed to `--step`.  [arg] is either
                    a path to or filename of a migration which will be passed
                    to `--to`.  This can be a relative or absolute path, or
                    simply the migration name.  The former does not work in
                    umbrella apps unless your cd into the app.

                    This command's bang [!] behaviour  works the same as it
                    does for |:Mix|.  Environment flags via `^` and `+` are
                    also available.

                    Only available in a mix project with Ecto.


                                            *mixer-:Rollback* *:Rollback*
:{count}Rollback[!] [arg]
                    Rollback migrations with autocomplete.

                    Works just like |:Migrate| in reverse.

                    A fun trick with `:Rollback` is to navigate to a migration
                    file you want to rollback to and issue:
>
                      :Rollback %
<
                    This will rollback to this migration.  `:Migrate` works
                    the same way should you find yourself not wanting to fully
                    migrate back to latest.

                    Only available in mix projects with Ecto.

                                            *mixer-:Console* *:Console*
:Console[!]         Start `iex` in a `:terminal` session.  The exact command
                    used is:
>
                      term ++close iex -S mix
<
                    When called with a bang [!] it will start a plain iex
                    session without Mix.  Outside of a mix project both
                    versions of the command start a plain `iex` session.

                    Accepts |:command-modifiers|.


MAPPINGS                                    *mixer-mappings*

                                            *mixer-CTRL-]*
CTRL-]              Remapped to be context aware in Phoenix files. Will
                    jump from `phx-click="some-event"` to
                    `handle_event("some-event"...`.  It will also attempt to
                    find JS hook definitions from `phx-hook="MyHook"`.  If it
                    cannot find `MyHook =` in your js/ directory, it looks for
                    a .js or .ts file that resembles the name of your hook.
                    It otherwise works as normal.

                    This command's implementation requires your project to be
                    tracked by `git`.  I would like to change this sooner or
                    later.


TEXT OBJECTS                                *mixer-text-objects*
                                            *mixer-text-object*
                                            *mixer-textobj*

Text objects are defined for general Elixir blocks (do/end, fn/end), as well
as maps, sigils, and comments/docstrings.  There are some specialized objects
for the def* family of macros where the 'aF' version includes specs,
docstrings, LiveView's `attr` and `slot`, as well as other meta.

Here is an overview:


    Elixir construct    | Text Object  (mneumonic/notes)
    --------------------+------------------------------------------------
    blocks              | d  (do, but also fb)
    blocks              | D  (includes assignment comments)
    def[p]/defmarco[p]  | f
    def[p]/defmacro[p]  | F  (includes annotations and all function heads)
    defmodule           | M
    %{}/%Fooi.Bar{}     | m  (maps and structs)
    Sigils              | S 
    #/@doc """/etc      | c  (comment)


                    Do/end block~
id                                          *mixer-ie* *mixer-ae*
ad                  A do/end block including function call.
iD
aD                  Currently brings `else` along with it.

                    A reasonable effort is made for these to be as general as
                    possible and work with custom macros, not just the
                    builtins.  They work with both `do`/`end` syntax as
                    well as keyword syntax (`do: ...`).

                    "aD" will include assignment (pattern matching) and
                    any comments.  For example, in the following code with the
                    cursor represented by `\%#`, typing `daD` will delete all
                    of the following:
>
                      # Set foo to bar()
                      # if `condition?` is `true`
                      let foo =
                        if condition? do
                          bar\%#()
                        end
<
                    Note that for comments to be included, they must be
                    touching the code block.  If separated by a blank line
                    they will be left alone.

                    `defmacrop` as well as `defn` for Nx'ers.

                    "aF" will include any function annotations as well
                    surrounding functions with the same name, including
                    private functions prefixed with `do_`.  A small list
                    of well-known annotations are considered (definitively:
                    `@doc`, `@spec`, `@tag`, and `@requirements`) as well as
                    LiveView's `attr` and `slot` macros.  Otherwise, anything
                    between these and the function head and anything touching
                    the function head (no blank lines) will be included.

                    If necessary, it is possible to add your own by setting
                    `g:mixer_known_annotations` to a regex.  For example:
>
                      let g:mixer_known_annotations =
                        \ '\<my_macro\>\|@my_attribute\>'
<

                    NOTE When including surrounding function heads, artity is
                    NOT taken into account.

                    These are only available if the plugin sideways.vim is
                    installed.  You can find this on www.vim.org or on github

Text Object Options~
                                            *mixer-text-objects-options*
By default, text objects use the "seek" behaviour.  This means if you type
`daf` outside of a function, it will delete the next function searching
downward.  You may turn this off with the following setting:
>
  let g:mixer_textobj_noseek = 'ALL'
<
Now your cursor must be on an object to operate on it.  `a` variants will
still take whitespace into consideration.  For example, `daf` will still work
if your cursor is on the first blank line above it.

Fine-grained control over which objects use seek is possible by providing
a comma comma-separate string where the possible values are:
>
  let g:mixer_textobj_noseek = 'block'
<
This is the default.

There is also a special setting for the `block` text object:
>
  let g:mixer_textobj_block = 'doend'
<
This makes it so your cursor must be in the `do` to operate on it.  Some users
may find this more intuitive.
